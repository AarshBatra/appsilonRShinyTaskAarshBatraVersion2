Description: Creates a leaflet map that shows the maximum distance travelled
       for a given ship  as two markers on the map, with a line between them. 
    This distance is calculated from the travel history data
    (lon and lat coordinates) of that particular ship. A specific ship 
    is selected using ship_type and ship_name filters.
