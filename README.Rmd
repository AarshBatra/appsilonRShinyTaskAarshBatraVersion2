# appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatraVersion2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatraVersion2 is to visualize the marine dataset to 
figure out the max distance travelled by a ship between two consecutive points 
given all of its trips.

# Improvements over the previous version

* The initial error that was showing up (for the first few seconds) while rendering the map,
is now resolved.

* Better UI using grid graphics from the shiny.semantic library. 

## App

* The app is deployed online at shinyapps.io. Click   [here](https://aarsh.shinyapps.io/appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatraVersion2/) to view the app.
  
* To view underlying app code, look into the **app.R** file.

## Code

* All of the functions used to make distance calculations can be found in 
  the **shinyTaskMasterScript.R** file. This file is present in the R 
  sub-directory.

* Documentation for all of the functions is auto-generated by roxygen2 
  and can be found in the **man** folder.

* Note: Although I have used **roxygen2** package for commenting for all code
        files. This repository is not a R package. There
        is some more work that will go into this before this becomes a
        R package. I will work on that after submitting this task.
        
## Tests

* All of the tests done using the **testthat()** package are present in 
  inst/tests/tests.R
        
## Data

* Raw marine data zip file that is used for all calculations is contained
  in the **data-raw** directory.
  
## Further Information

* For any questions regarding the app and the code please feel free to email me
  at aarshbatra.in@gmail.com.
