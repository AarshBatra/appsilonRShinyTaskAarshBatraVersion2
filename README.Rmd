# appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatraVersion2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatraVersion2 is to visualize the marine dataset to 
figure out the max distance travelled by a ship between two consecutive points 
given all of its trips.

# Improvements over the previous (v1) version

* The initial error that was previously showing up while rendering the map is now fixed. Previously (last week while submitting the version 1 of the app), I was a bit behind on Reactivity and Modules in R. Since then, I have read and practiced reactivity and modules comprehensively (mainly from Hadley's [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html) book, it is a great resource).

* I have utilized the shiny.semantic grid functionality to improve on the user interface of the app. This has helped in getting a better user interface both on desktop and mobile.

* Added functionality (more controls) to the leaflet map to get a better sense of distance travelled and scales.

## App

* The app is deployed online at shinyapps.io. Click   [here](https://aarsh.shinyapps.io/appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatraVersion2/) to view the app.
  
* To view underlying app code, look into the **app.R** file.

## Code

* All of the functions used to make distance calculations can be found in 
  the **shinyTaskMasterScript.R** file. This file is present in the R 
  sub-directory.

* Documentation for all of the functions is auto-generated by roxygen2 
  and can be found in the **man** folder.

        
## Tests

* All of the tests done using the **testthat()** package are present in 
  inst/tests/tests.R
        
## Data

* Raw marine data zip file that is used for all calculations is contained
  in the **data-raw** directory.
  
## GitHub issue #354

* I would like to mention that I was facing some issues using the built in layouts in the shiny.semantic library. Specifically, the sidebar_layout() function was not rendering the UI elements as it should. 

* I performed a lot of troubleshooting, but it did not fix the issue. I have filed an issue on the official GitHub page for the shiny.semantic detailing the exact problem and troubleshooting steps I took to try fix it.

* Here is the link to the GitHub issue, kindly please have a look: [Link to issue #354](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic/issues/354#issue-810600777)
